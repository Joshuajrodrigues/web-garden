# Booary

Booary is a web component designed to display a reading history in the style of a vintage library card. It uses a JSON file as a database and supports yearly archiving and friend cross-referencing.
Usage

1. Installation

Include the library via CDN in your HTML or Astro project:

```HTML

<script src="https://unpkg.com/booary"></script>
```

2. Implementation

Place the custom element in your code. It requires a link to your local data and can optionally accept an array of friend URLs.

```HTML
<x-library-card
  cardlink="/library/card.json"
  friends='["https://friend-site.com/library/card.json"]'>
</x-library-card>
```

<x-library-card 
  cardlink="/library/card.json" 
  friends='["https://friend-site.com/library/card.json"]'>
</x-library-card>

### The CLI

The package includes a command-line interface to manage your library without manual JSON editing.

To run the CLI:

```Bash

pnpm booary
```

### Functionality:

Initialization: Configures your borrower name and library name on the first run.

Book Search: Queries the Open Library API to find book details.

Automatic Archiving: New books are filed under the current year. If a year does not exist in your history, the CLI creates it.

### Features:

Yearly Navigation: Toggle between different years using the navigation arrows to view historical reading data.

Social Discovery: If a friend in your list has read the same book in the same year, their librarian signature will appear next to that book on your card.

Encapsulated Design: Built as a standard Web Component that works across all modern browsers and frameworks.

### Data Structure

The card.json file is organized by years to allow for historical browsing.

```JSON

{
  "borrower": "User Name",
  "library": {
    "name": "Library Name",
    "signature": "JS"
  },
  "years": {
    "2025": [
      {
        "key": "/works/OL12345W",
        "name": "Book Title",
        "author": "Author Name",
        "finishedDate": "01/01/2025"
      }
    ],
    "2026": []
  }
}
```
